If you're anything like me, you are curious about the computer's inner workings. One of the most powerful and important components is called the Centeral Processing Unit, or CPU. It's basically the brain of the computer. As StoryBots puts it, a computer/CPU is 3 simple steps: Input, Processing, Output.

**Input:** In this step, the CPU retrieves information from a memory source, such as RAM (Random Access Memory), ROM (Read Only Memory), Storage (USB drives/sticks/thumb drives, Hard disks, floppy disks, etc), or direct user input from a device like a keyboard. This process is like a student learning a new concept in school or remembering the answer to a question on a test. In computers, input is generally in one of the two forms: Instructions, which are the most important, or data, such as addresses to access different things in the computer, or simple numbers and letters. Let's go more in depth with these two forms of input

- Instructions
    - These are like your parents telling you to do your chores or your teacher telling you what your assignment is and how to do it. Instructions are words (in assembly, we'll talk about how that works later on) like CMP, which stands for Compare

**Processing:** In this step, the CPU does the work it is told to do from input. There are a lot of things that can go on during processing, such as math operations, reading information from storage, etc.
